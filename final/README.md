# Final.

Hi.

This is almost definitely broken unless I woke up with the solution to it last minute.

I dreamt big and I don't want to say I crashed but I took on something maybe 10% out of my skillset. 

I learned a lot! I used a lot of cool tech and had alot of "aha!" moments but ultimately I never wish to do this again. I've included the dataset I used as `data.csv.zst`, to run this locally you'll need Python Poetry. Run `poetry install` from the base directory and dream.
